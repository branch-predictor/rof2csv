rof2csv - command-line tool to convert Rigol ROF files to CSV
==============================================================

(c) 2025 Piotr Da≈Çek (https://github.com/branch-predictor)

This tool can be used to convert ROF files (produced by Rigol DP800 Series programmable power supplies) into something that's actually human-usable, that is - comma-separated values file, that can be then used with anything else, like Excel.

Automatically infers number of channels in file and denotes each sample with correct timestamp.

Example output file contents:

Time;Ch1 V; Ch1 A;Ch2 V; Ch2 A;Ch3 V; Ch3 A;
00:00:00;4,9949;0,0551;0,0026;0,0003;0,0001;0,0003;
00:00:01;4,9949;0,0565;0,0025;0,0003;0,0002;0,0003;
00:00:02;4,9948;0,0551;0,0026;0,0003;0,0001;0,0003;
00:00:03;4,9948;0,0532;0,0027;0,0003;0,0001;0,0003;
00:00:04;4,9948;0,0566;0,0027;0,0003;0,0002;0,0003;

  -fdd        use colon (dot) as float separator
  -fdc        use comma as float separator
              NOTE: defaults to whatever system locale uses

Go to https://github.com/branch-predictor/rof2csv, clone the repo or download it as .zip file.
Any Delphi or FreePascal version should work, just feed your compiler with "rof2csv.dpr" file.
